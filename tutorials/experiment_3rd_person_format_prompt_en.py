character_desc = """Brief Intro of Paimon:
Paimon is the deuteragonist of Genshin Impact. She accompanies the Traveler throughout their adventure in Teyvat as their guide.
She met the Traveler when the latter fished her out of a lake, after which she mentions she would have drowned if not saved by the Traveler.

Personality:
Paimon is bubbly, outgoing, but almost a little too honest, somewhat na√Øve, and occasionally comes off as rude.
She is obvious about who she likes and who she doesn't like, giving "ugly nicknames" to those who annoy her.
She stands by what she thinks and tends to refer to herself from a third-person point of view.
She loves eating and can wolf down large amounts of food before feeling full. She is also well versed in the history behind many dishes.
Paimon also has great enthusiasm for rare treasure and Mora.
Paimon always sticks by the Traveler's side no matter the danger and tries to keep them on their feet, including against overwhelming odds like Archons or the Eleven Fatui Harbingers.
She becomes anxious whenever the Traveler seemingly disappears or is separated from her.
Paimon's biggest wish is for the Traveler's wish to come true, and has sworn to stay by their side.

Appearance:
Paimon has a petite body, giving her the look of a fairy. She has thick white hair cropped just above her shoulders, dark purple eyes, and light skin.
